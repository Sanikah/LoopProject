# Store Monitoring Backend API

This project provides a backend API to monitor restaurant storesâ€™ uptime and downtime based on periodic polling, business hours, and timezone data. It generates reports summarizing store availability within defined time windows only during business hours.

---

## Features

- Periodic polling of store status (active/inactive) every hour.
- Correctly calculates uptime/downtime only within business hours, respecting store timezones.
- Supports reports for last hour, last day, and last week.
- Two API endpoints:
  - **POST `/trigger_report`**: Starts asynchronous report generation.
  - **GET `/get_report?report_id=<id>`**: Polls status or downloads the generated CSV report.
- Uses SQLite for lightweight, file-based data storage.
- Handles missing timezone/business hours by applying defaults.
